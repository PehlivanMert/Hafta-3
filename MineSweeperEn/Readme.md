# MineSweeper Game

This project involves the implementation of the classic MineSweeper game. The game prompts the user to input the dimensions of the game board, randomly places mines, and then accepts player moves. As the game progresses, the player opens cells, and at the end of the game, it checks whether the player has won or lost. ðŸŽ®

- `private void createDisplayedMap(int numRows, int numCols)`: Method to create the map displayed to the player. It initializes the matrix with "-" values.

- `private void playGame(int numRows, int numCols)`: Method to play the game. It accepts player moves, opens cells, and checks the game's status.

- `private void showDisplayedMap()`: Method to show the displayed map to the player.

- `private boolean isValidMove(int row, int col, int numRows, int numCols)`: Method to check if the move is valid.

- `private void placeMines(int numMines)`: Method to randomly place the mines.
